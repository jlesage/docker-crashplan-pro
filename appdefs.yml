      - title: Taking Over Existing Backup
        level: 2
        content: |-
          If this container is replacing a CrashPlan installation (from Linux, Windows,
          MAC or another Docker container), your existing backup can be taken over to
          avoid re-uploading all your data.

          To proceed, make sure to carefully read the [official documentation].

          Here is a summary of what needs to be done:
            1. Start CrashPlan Docker container.  Make sure the configuration directory
               is not mapped to a folder used by a different CrashPlan container.
            2. Sign in to your account.
            3. Click the **Replace Existing** button to start the wizard.
            4. Skip *Step 2 - File Transfer*.
            4. Once done with the wizard, go to your device's details and click
               *Manage Files*.  You will probably see missing items in the file
               selection.  This is normal, since path to your files may be different in
               the container.
            5. Update the file selection by re-adding your files.  **Do not unselect
               missing items yet**.
            6. Perform a backup.  Because of deduplication, files will not be uploaded
               again.
            7. Once the backup is terminated, you can remove missing items **if you
               don't care about file versions**.  Else, keep missing items.

          **NOTE**: Don't be confused by the directory structure from your old being
          visible in the *Manage Files* window.  By default, your files are now located
          under the `/storage` folder.

      - title: Why CrashPlan Self Update Is Disabled
        level: 2
        content: |-
          One advantage of a Docker image is that it can be versioned and predictable,
          meaning that a specific version of the image always behaves the same way.  So
          if, for any reason, a new image version has a problem and doesn't work as
          expected, it's easy for one to revert to the previous version and be back on
          track.

          Allowing CrashPlan to update itself obviously breaks this benefit.  Also, since
          the container has only the minimal set of libraries and tools required to run
          CrashPlan, it would be easy for an automatic update to break the container by
          requiring new dependencies.  Finally, the automatic update script is not adapted
          for Alpine Linux (the distribution on which this container is based on) and
          assumes it is running on a full-featured distribution.  For example, this image
          doesn't have a desktop like normal installations and some of the tools required
          to perform the update are missing.

        level: 2
      - title: Crashes / Maximum Amount of Allocated Memory
        level: 3
        content: |-
          If CrashPlan crashes unexpectedly with large backups, try to increase the
          maximum amount of memory CrashPlan is allowed to use. This can be done by:

            1. Setting the `CRASHPLAN_SRV_MAX_MEM` environment variable.  See the
               [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for more details.
            2. Using the [solution provided by CrashPlan] from its support site.

          [solution provided by CrashPlan]: https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827635282583-Adjust-Code42-agent-settings-for-memory-usage-with-large-backups
      - title: Inotify's Watch Limit
        level: 3
        content: |-
          If CrashPlan exceeds inotify's max watch limit, real-time file watching cannot
          work properly and the inotify watch limit needs to be increased on the **host**,
          not the container.

          For more details, see the CrashPlan's [Linux real-time file watching errors]
          article.

      - title: Synology
        level: 4
        content: |-
          On Synology NAS, the instructions provided by the article mentioned in the
          previous section apply, except that the inotify's max watch limit must be set in
          `/etc.defaults/sysctl.conf` (instead of `/etc/sysctl.conf`) to make the setting
          permanent.

          **NOTE**: After an upgrade of the DSM software, verify that the content of the
          file has not been overwritten.
      - title: Empty `/storage`
        level: 3
        content: |-
          If the `/storage` folder inside the container is empty:

            - Make sure the folder is properly mapped to the host.  This is done via the
              `-v` parameter of the `docker run` command.  See the [Usage](#usage)
              section.
            - Make sure permissions and ownership of files on the host are correct and are
              compatible with the user under which the container application is running
              (defined by the `USER_ID` and `GROUP_ID` environment variables).  See the
              [User/Group IDs](#usergroup-ids) section.

          NOTE: If running the application as root (`USER_ID=0` and `GROUP_ID=0`) makes
          the files visible, it confirms that there is a permission issue.
      - title: Device Status Is Waiting For Connection
        level: 3
        content: |-
          If the status of your device is stuck on *Waiting for connection*, clearing the
          the cache of CrashPlan can help resolve the issue:

            - Stop the container.
            - Remove all the content of the `cache` directory found under the container's
              configuration directory.  For example, if the `/config` folder of the
              container is mapped to `/docker/appdata/crashplan-pro` on the host, the
              following command (ran on the host) would clear the cache:
              ```
              rm -rf /docker/appdata/crashplan-pro/cache/*
              ```
            - Start the container.
      - title: Cannot Restore Files
        level: 3
        content: |-
          If CrashPlan fails to restore files, make sure the location where files are
          restored have write permission.

          A typical installation has the data to be backup under the `/storage` folder.
          This folder is usually mapped to the host with *read-only* permission.  Thus,
          restoring files to `/storage` won't be allowed.  The solution is to temporarily
          change the permission of the volume to *read-write*.

          For example, if `/storage` is mapped to `/home/user` on the host, the container
          would need to be deleted and then re-created with the same arguments, with the
          exception of `-v /home/user:/storage:ro` that is replaced with
          `-v /home/user:/storage:rw`.
      - title: Upgrade Failed Error Message
        level: 3
        content: |-
          Because the CrashPlan's self-upgrade feature is disabled in this container, an
          error message about failed upgrade can be seen when a new CrashPlan version is
          released.

          To fix this, [updating the container's image](#docker-image-update) to the
          latest version will also bring the latest version of CrashPlan.
