This project provides a Docker container for [CrashPlan](https://www.crashplan.com).

The graphical user interface (GUI) of the application can be accessed through a
modern web browser, requiring no installation or configuration on the client
side, or via any VNC client.

This Docker container can be used with all CrashPlan products: Essential,
Professional, Enterprise, MSPs and Small Business (no longer sold).

## Quick Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Docker command provided in this quick start is an example, and parameters
> should be adjusted to suit your needs.

Launch the CrashPlan docker container with the following command:

```shell
docker run -d \
    --name=crashplan-pro \
    -p 5800:5800 \
    -v /docker/appdata/crashplan-pro:/config:rw \
    -v /home/user:/storage:ro \
    jlesage/crashplan-pro
```

Where:

  - `/docker/appdata/crashplan-pro`: Stores the application's configuration, state, logs, and any files requiring persistency.
  - `/home/user`: Contains files from the host that need to be accessible to the application.

Access the CrashPlan GUI by browsing to `http://your-host-ip:5800`.
Files from the host appear under the `/storage` folder in the container.

## Usage

```shell
docker run [-d] \
    --name=crashplan-pro \
    [-e <VARIABLE_NAME>=<VALUE>]... \
    [-v <HOST_DIR>:<CONTAINER_DIR>[:PERMISSIONS]]... \
    [-p <HOST_PORT>:<CONTAINER_PORT>]... \
    jlesage/crashplan-pro
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| -d        | Runs the container in the background. If not set, the container runs in the foreground. |
| -e        | Passes an environment variable to the container. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for details. |
| -v        | Sets a volume mapping to share a folder or file between the host and the container. See [Data Volumes](#data-volumes) for details. |
| -p        | Sets a network port mapping to expose an internal container port to the host). See [Ports](#ports) for details. |

### Environment Variables

To customize the container's behavior, you can pass environment variables using
the `-e` parameter in the format `<VARIABLE_NAME>=<VALUE>`.

| Variable       | Description                                  | Default |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|---------|
|`USER_ID`| ID of the user the application runs as. See [User/Group IDs](#usergroup-ids) for details. | `1000` |
|`GROUP_ID`| ID of the group the application runs as. See [User/Group IDs](#usergroup-ids) for details. | `1000` |
|`SUP_GROUP_IDS`| Comma-separated list of supplementary group IDs for the application. | (no value) |
|`UMASK`| Mask controlling permissions for newly created files and folders, specified in octal notation. By default, `0022` ensures files and folders are readable by all but writable only by the owner. See the umask calculator at http://wintelguy.com/umask-calc.pl. | `0022` |
|`LANG`| Sets the [locale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_(computer_software)), defining the application's language, if supported. Format is `language[_territory][.codeset]`, where language is an [ISO 639 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), territory is an [ISO 3166 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes), and codeset is a character set, like `UTF-8`. For example, Australian English using UTF-8 is `en_AU.UTF-8`. | `en_US.UTF-8` |
|`TZ`| [TimeZone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) used by the container. The timezone can also be set by mapping `/etc/localtime` between the host and the container. | `Etc/UTC` |
|`KEEP_APP_RUNNING`| When set to `1`, the application is automatically restarted if it crashes or terminates. | `0` |
|`APP_NICENESS`| Priority at which the application runs. A niceness value of -20 is the highest, 19 is the lowest and 0 the default. **NOTE**: A negative niceness (priority increase) requires additional permissions. The container must be run with the Docker option `--cap-add=SYS_NICE`. | `0` |
|`INSTALL_PACKAGES`| Space-separated list of packages to install during container startup. List of available packages can be found at https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org. | (no value) |
|`PACKAGES_MIRROR`| Mirror of the repository to use when installing packages. List of mirrors is available at https://mirrors.alpinelinux.org. | (no value) |
|`CONTAINER_DEBUG`| When set to `1`, enables debug logging. | `0` |
|`DISPLAY_WIDTH`| Width (in pixels) of the application's window. | `1920` |
|`DISPLAY_HEIGHT`| Height (in pixels) of the application's window. | `1080` |
|`DARK_MODE`| When set to `1`, enables dark mode for the application. See Dark Mode](#dark-mode) for details. | `0` |
|`WEB_AUDIO`| When set to `1`, enables audio support, allowing audio produced by the application to play through the browser. See [Web Audio](#web-audio) for details. | `0` |
|`WEB_FILE_MANAGER`| When set to `1`, enables the web file manager, allowing interaction with files inside the container through the web browser, supporting operations like renaming, deleting, uploading, and downloading. See [Web File Manager](#web-file-manager) for details. | `0` |
|`WEB_FILE_MANAGER_ALLOWED_PATHS`| Comma-separated list of paths within the container that the file manager can access. By default, the container's entire filesystem is not accessible, and this variable specifies allowed paths. If set to `AUTO`, commonly used folders and those mapped to the container are automatically allowed. The value `ALL` allows access to all paths (no restrictions). See [Web File Manager](#web-file-manager) for details. | `AUTO` |
|`WEB_FILE_MANAGER_DENIED_PATHS`| Comma-separated list of paths within the container that the file manager cannot access. A denied path takes precedence over an allowed path. See [Web File Manager](#web-file-manager) for details. | (no value) |
|`WEB_AUTHENTICATION`| When set to `1`, protects the application's GUI with a login page when accessed via a web browser. Access is granted only with valid credentials. This feature requires the secure connection to be enabled. See [Web Authentication](#web-authentication) for details. | `0` |
|`WEB_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN_VALIDITY_TIME`| Lifetime of a token, in hours. A token is assigned to the user after successful login. As long as the token is valid, the user can access the application's GUI without logging in again. Once the token expires, the login page is displayed again. | `24` |
|`WEB_AUTHENTICATION_USERNAME`| Optional username for web authentication. Provides a quick and easy way to configure credentials for a single user. For more secure configuration or multiple users, see the [Web Authentication](#web-authentication) section. | (no value) |
|`WEB_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD`| Optional password for web authentication. Provides a quick and easy way to configure credentials for a single user. For more secure configuration or multiple users, see the [Web Authentication](#web-authentication) section. | (no value) |
|`SECURE_CONNECTION`| When set to `1`, uses an encrypted connection to access the application's GUI (via web browser or VNC client). See [Security](#security) for details. | `0` |
|`SECURE_CONNECTION_VNC_METHOD`| Method used for encrypted VNC connections. Possible values are `SSL` or `TLS`. See [Security](#security) for details. | `SSL` |
|`SECURE_CONNECTION_CERTS_CHECK_INTERVAL`| Interval, in seconds, at which the system checks if web or VNC certificates have changed. When a change is detected, affected services are automatically restarted. A value of `0` disables the check. | `60` |
|`WEB_LISTENING_PORT`| Port used by the web server to serve the application's GUI. This port is internal to the container and typically does not need to be changed. By default, a container uses the default bridge network, requiring each internal port to be mapped to an external port (using the `-p` or `--publish` argument). If another network type is used, changing this port may prevent conflicts with other services/containers. **NOTE**: A value of `-1` disables HTTP/HTTPS access to the application's GUI. | `5800` |
|`VNC_LISTENING_PORT`| Port used by the VNC server to serve the application's GUI. This port is internal to the container and typically does not need to be changed. By default, a container uses the default bridge network, requiring each internal port to be mapped to an external port (using the `-p` or `--publish` argument). If another network type is used, changing this port may prevent conflicts with other services/containers. **NOTE**: A value of `-1` disables VNC access to the application's GUI. | `5900` |
|`VNC_PASSWORD`| Password required to connect to the application's GUI. See the [VNC Password](#vnc-password) section for details. | (no value) |
|`ENABLE_CJK_FONT`| When set to `1`, installs the open-source font `WenQuanYi Zen Hei`, supporting a wide range of Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters. | `0` |
|`CRASHPLAN_SRV_MAX_MEM`| Maximum amount of memory the CrashPlan Engine is allowed to use. One of the following memory unit (case insensitive) should be added as a suffix to the size: `G`, `M` or `K`.  By default, when this variable is not set, a maximum of 1024MB (`1024M`) of memory is allowed. **NOTE**: Setting this variable as the same effect as running the `java mx VALUE, restart` command from the CrashPlan command line. | `1024M` |

#### Deployment Considerations

Many tools used to manage Docker containers extract environment variables
defined by the Docker image to create or deploy the container.

For example, this behavior is seen in:
  - The Docker application on Synology NAS
  - The Container Station on QNAP NAS
  - Portainer
  - etc.

While this is useful for users to adjust environment variable values to suit
their needs, keeping all of them can be confusing and even risky.

A good practice is to set or retain only the variables necessary for the
container to function as desired in your setup. If a variable is left at its
default value, it can be removed. Keep in mind that all environment variables
are optional; none are required for the container to start.

Removing unneeded environment variables offers several benefits:

  - Prevents retaining variables no longer used by the container. Over time,
    with image updates, some variables may become obsolete.
  - Allows the Docker image to update or fix default values. With image updates,
    default values may change to address issues or support new features.
  - Avoids changes to variables that could disrupt the container's
    functionality. Some undocumented variables, like `PATH` or `ENV`, are
    required but not meant to be modified by users, yet container management
    tools may expose them.
  - Addresses a bug in Container Station on QNAP and the Docker application on
    Synology, where variables without values may not be allowed. This behavior
    is incorrect, as variables without values are valid. Removing unneeded
    variables prevents deployment issues on these devices.

### Data Volumes

The following table describes the data volumes used by the container. Volume
mappings are set using the `-v` parameter with a value in the format
`<HOST_DIR>:<CONTAINER_DIR>[:PERMISSIONS]`.

| Container path  | Permissions | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
|`/config`| rw | Stores the application's configuration, state, logs, and any files requiring persistency. |
|`/storage`| ro | Contains files from the host that need to be accessible to the application. |

### Ports

The following table lists the ports used by the container.

When using the default bridge network, ports can be mapped to the host using the
`-p` parameter with value in the format `<HOST_PORT>:<CONTAINER_PORT>`. The
internal container port may not be changeable, but you can use any port on the
host side.

See the Docker [Docker Container Networking](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking)
documentation for details.

| Port | Protocol | Mapping to Host | Description |
|------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 5800 | TCP | Optional | Port to access the application's GUI via the web interface. Mapping to the host is optional if web access is not needed. For non-default bridge networks, the port can be changed with the `WEB_LISTENING_PORT` environment variable. |
| 5900 | TCP | Optional | Port to access the application's GUI via the VNC protocol. Mapping to the host is optional if VNC access is not needed. For non-default bridge networks, the port can be changed with the `VNC_LISTENING_PORT` environment variable. |

### Changing Parameters of a Running Container

Environment variables, volume mappings, and port mappings are specified when
creating the container. To modify these parameters for an existing container,
follow these steps:

  1. Stop the container (if it is running):
```shell
docker stop crashplan-pro
```

  2. Remove the container:
```shell
docker rm crashplan-pro
```

  3. Recreate and start the container using the `docker run` command, adjusting
     parameters as needed.

> [!NOTE]
> Since all application data is saved under the `/config` container folder,
> destroying and recreating the container does not result in data loss, and the
> application resumes with the same state, provided the `/config` folder
> mapping remains unchanged.

### Docker Compose File

Below is an example `docker-compose.yml` file for use with
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/).

Adjust the configuration to suit your needs. Only mandatory settings are
included in this example.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  crashplan-pro:
    image: jlesage/crashplan-pro
    ports:
      - "5800:5800"
    volumes:
      - "/docker/appdata/crashplan-pro:/config:rw"
      - "/home/user:/storage:ro"
```

## Docker Image Versioning and Tags

Each release of a Docker image is versioned, and each version as its own image
tag. Before October 2022, the versioning scheme followed
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

Since then, the versioning scheme has shifted to
[calendar versioning](https://calver.org) with the format `YY.MM.SEQUENCE`,
where:
  - `YY` is the zero-padded year (relative to year 2000).
  - `MM` is the zero-padded month.
  - `SEQUENCE` is the incremental release number within the month (first release
    is 1, second is 2, etc).

View all available tags on [Docker Hub] or check the [Releases] page for version
details.

[Releases]: https://github.com/jlesage/docker-crashplan-pro/releases
[Docker Hub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/jlesage/crashplan-pro/tags

## Docker Image Update

The Docker image is regularly updated to incorporate new features, fix issues,
or integrate newer versions of the containerized application. Several methods
can be used to update the Docker image.

If your system provides a built-in method for updating containers, this should
be your primary approach.

Alternatively, you can use [Watchtower], a container-based solution for
automating Docker image updates. Watchtower seamlessly handles updates when a
new image is available.

To manually update the Docker image, follow these steps:

  1. Fetch the latest image:
```shell
docker pull jlesage/crashplan-pro
```

  2. Stop the container:
```shell
docker stop crashplan-pro
```

  3. Remove the container:
```shell
docker rm crashplan-pro
```

  4. Recreate and start the container using the `docker run` command, with the
     same parameters used during initial deployment.

[Watchtower]: https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower

### Synology

For Synology NAS users, follow these steps to update a container image:

  1.  Open the *Docker* application.
  2.  Click *Registry* in the left pane.
  3.  In the search bar, type the name of the container (`jlesage/crashplan-pro`).
  4.  Select the image, click *Download*, and choose the `latest` tag.
  5.  Wait for the download to complete. A notification will appear once done.
  6.  Click *Container* in the left pane.
  7.  Select your CrashPlan container.
  8.  Stop it by clicking *Action* -> *Stop*.
  9.  Clear the container by clicking *Action* -> *Reset* (or *Action* ->
      *Clear* if you don't have the latest *Docker* application). This removes
      the container while keeping its configuration.
  10. Start the container again by clicking *Action* -> *Start*. **NOTE**:  The
      container may temporarily disappear from the list while it is recreated.

### unRAID

For unRAID users, update a container image with these steps:

  1. Select the *Docker* tab.
  2. Click the *Check for Updates* button at the bottom of the page.
  3. Click the *apply update* link of the container to be updated.

## User/Group IDs

When mapping data volumes (using the `-v` flag of the `docker run` command),
permission issues may arise between the host and the container. Files and
folders in a data volume are owned by a user, which may differ from the user
running the application. Depending on permissions, this could prevent the
container from accessing the shared volume.

To avoid this, specify the user the application should run as using the
`USER_ID` and `GROUP_ID` environment variables.

To find the appropriate IDs, run the following command on the host for the user
owning the data volume:

```shell
id <username>
```

This produces output like:

```
uid=1000(myuser) gid=1000(myuser) groups=1000(myuser),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),46(plugdev),113(lpadmin)
```

Use the `uid` (user ID) and `gid` (group ID) values to configure the container.

## Accessing the GUI

Assuming the container's ports are mapped to the same host's ports, access the
application's GUI as follows:

  - Via a web browser:

```text
http://<HOST_IP_ADDR>:5800
```

  - Via any VNC client:

```text
<HOST_IP_ADDR>:5900
```

## Security

By default, access to the application's GUI uses an unencrypted connection (HTTP
or VNC).

A secure connection can be enabled via the `SECURE_CONNECTION` environment
variable. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for
details on configuring environment variables.

When enabled, the GUI is accessed over HTTPS when using a browser, with all HTTP
accesses redirected to HTTPS.

For VNC clients, the connection can be secured using on of two methods,
configured via the `SECURE_CONNECTION_VNC_METHOD` environment variable:

  - `SSL`: An SSL tunnel is used to transport the VNC connection. Few VNC
    clients supports this method; [SSVNC] is one that does.
  - `TLS`: A VNC security type negotiated during the VNC handshake. It uses TLS
    to establish a secure connection. Clients may optionally validate the
    server’s certificate. Valid certificates must be provided for this
    validation to succeed. See [Certificates](#certificates) for details.
    [TigerVNC] is a client that supports TLS encryption.

[TigerVNC]: https://tigervnc.org

### SSVNC

[SSVNC] is a VNC viewer that adds encryption to VNC connections by using an
SSL tunnel to transport the VNC traffic.

While the Linux version of [SSVNC] works well, the Windows version has issues.
At the time of writing, the latest version `1.0.30` fails with the error:

```text
ReadExact: Socket error while reading
```

For convenience, an unofficial, working version is provided here:

https://github.com/jlesage/docker-baseimage-gui/raw/master/tools/ssvnc_windows_only-1.0.30-r1.zip

This version upgrades the bundled `stunnel` to version `5.49`, resolving the
connection issues.

[SSVNC]: http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/ssvnc.html

### Certificates

The following certificate files are required by the container. If missing,
self-signed certificates are generated and used. All files are PEM-encoded x509
certificates.

| Container Path                  | Purpose                    | Content |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------|---------|
|`/config/certs/vnc-server.pem`   |VNC connection encryption.  |VNC server's private key and certificate, bundled with any root and intermediate certificates.|
|`/config/certs/web-privkey.pem`  |HTTPS connection encryption.|Web server's private key.|
|`/config/certs/web-fullchain.pem`|HTTPS connection encryption.|Web server's certificate, bundled with any root and intermediate certificates.|

> [!TIP]
> To avoid certificate validity warnings or errors in browsers or VNC clients,
> provide your own valid certificates.

> [!NOTE]
> Certificate files are monitored, and relevant services are restarted when
> changes are detected.

### VNC Password

To restrict access to your application, set a password using one of two methods:
  - Via the `VNC_PASSWORD` environment variable.
  - Via a `.vncpass_clear` file at the root of the `/config` volume, containing
    the password in clear text. During container startup, the content is
    obfuscated and moved to `.vncpass`.

The security of the VNC password depends on:
  - The communication channel (encrypted or unencrypted).
  - The security of host access.

When using a VNC password, enable a secure connection to prevent sending the
password in clear text over an unencrypted channel.

Unauthorized users with sufficient host privileges can retrieve the password by:

  - Viewing the `VNC_PASSWORD` environment variable via `docker inspect`. By
    default, the `docker` command requires root access, but it can be configured
    to allow users in a specific group.
  - Decrypting the `/config/.vncpass` file, which requires root or `USER_ID`
    permissions.

> [!CAUTION]
> VNC password is limited to 8 characters. This limitation comes from the Remote
> Framebuffer Protocol [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6143) (see section
> [7.2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6143#section-7.2.2)).

### Web Authentication

Access to the application's GUI via a web browser can be protected with a login
page. When enabled, users must provide valid credentials to gain access.

Enable web authentication by setting the `WEB_AUTHENTICATION` environment
variable to `1`. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section
for details on configuring environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Web authentication requires a secure connection to be enabled. See
> [Security](#security) for details.

#### Configuring Users Credentials

User credentials can be configured in two ways:

  1. Via container environment variables.
  2. Via a password database.

Container environment variables provide a quick way to configure a single user.
Set the username and password using:
  - `WEB_AUTHENTICATION_USERNAME`
  - `WEB_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD`

See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details on
configuring environment variables.

For a more secure method or to configure multiple users, use a password database
at `/config/webauth-htpasswd` within the container. This file uses the Apache
HTTP server's htpasswd format, storing bcrypt-hashed passwords.

Manage users with the `webauth-user` tool:
  - Add a user: `docker exec -ti <container name> webauth-user add <username>`
  - Update a user: `docker exec -ti <container name> webauth-user update <username>`
  - Remove a user: `docker exec <container name> webauth-user del <username>`
  - List users: `docker exec <container name> webauth-user list`

## Reverse Proxy

The following sections provide NGINX configurations for setting up a reverse
proxy to this container.

A reverse proxy server can route HTTP requests based on the hostname or URL
path.

### Routing Based on Hostname

In this scenario, each hostname is routed to a different application or
container.

For example, if the reverse proxy server runs on the same machine as this
container, it would proxy all HTTP requests for `crashplan-pro.domain.tld` to
the container at `127.0.0.1:5800`.

Here are the relevant configuration elements to add to the NGINX configuration:

```nginx
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
	default upgrade;
	''      close;
}

upstream docker-crashplan-pro {
	# If the reverse proxy server is not running on the same machine as the
	# Docker container, use the IP of the Docker host here.
	# Make sure to adjust the port according to how port 5800 of the
	# container has been mapped on the host.
	server 127.0.0.1:5800;
}

server {
	[...]

	server_name crashplan-pro.domain.tld;

	location / {
	        proxy_pass http://docker-crashplan-pro;
	}

	location /websockify {

### Routing Based on URL Path

In this scenario, the same hostname is used, but different URL paths route to
different applications or containers. For example, if the reverse proxy server
runs on the same machine as this container, it would proxy all HTTP requests for
`server.domain.tld/filebot` to the container at `127.0.0.1:5800`.

Here are the relevant configuration elements to add to the NGINX configuration:

```nginx
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
	default upgrade;
	''      close;
}

upstream docker-crashplan-pro {
	# If the reverse proxy server is not running on the same machine as the
	# Docker container, use the IP of the Docker host here.
	# Make sure to adjust the port according to how port 5800 of the
	# container has been mapped on the host.
	server 127.0.0.1:5800;
}

server {
	[...]

	location = /crashplan-pro {return 301 $scheme://$http_host/crashplan-pro/;}
	location /crashplan-pro/ {
		proxy_pass http://docker-crashplan-pro/;
		# Uncomment the following line if your Nginx server runs on a port that
		# differs from the one seen by external clients.
		#port_in_redirect off;
		location /crashplan-pro/websockify {
			proxy_pass http://docker-crashplan-pro/websockify;
			proxy_http_version 1.1;
			proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
			proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
			proxy_read_timeout 86400;
		}
		# Needed when audio support is enabled.
		location /crashplan-pro/websockify-audio {
			proxy_pass http://docker-crashplan-pro/websockify-audio;
			proxy_http_version 1.1;
			proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
			proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
			proxy_read_timeout 86400;
		}
	}
}

```

### Web Audio

The container supports streaming audio from the application, played through the
user's web browser. Audio is not supported for VNC clients.

Audio is streamed with the following specification:

  * Raw PCM format
  * 2 channels
  * 16-bit sample depth
  * 44.1kHz sample rate

Enable web audio by setting `WEB_AUDIO` to `1`. See the
[Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details on
configuring environment variables.

### Web File Manager

The container includes a simple file manager for interacting with container
files through a web browser, supporting operations like renaming, deleting,
uploading, and downloading.

Enable the file manager by setting `WEB_FILE_MANAGER` to `1`. See the
[Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details on
configuring environment variables.

By default, the container's entire filesystem is not accessible. The
`WEB_FILE_MANAGER_ALLOWED_PATHS` environment variable is a comma-separated list
that specifies which paths within the container are allowed to be accessed. When
set to `AUTO` (the default), it automatically includes commonly used folders and
any folders mapped to the container.

The `WEB_FILE_MANAGER_DENIED_PATHS` environment variable defines which paths are
explicitly denied access by the file manager. A denied path takes precedence
over an allowed one.

## Shell Access

To access the shell of a running container, execute the following command:

```shell
docker exec -ti CONTAINER sh
```

Where `CONTAINER` is the ID or the name of the container used during its
creation.

## Taking Over Existing Backup

If this container is replacing a CrashPlan installation (from Linux, Windows,
MAC or another Docker container), your existing backup can be taken over to
avoid re-uploading all your data.

To proceed, make sure to carefully read the [official documentation].

Here is a summary of what needs to be done:
  1. Start CrashPlan Docker container.  Make sure the configuration directory
     is not mapped to a folder used by a different CrashPlan container.
  2. Sign in to your account.
  3. Click the **Replace Existing** button to start the wizard.
  4. Skip *Step 2 - File Transfer*.
  4. Once done with the wizard, go to your device's details and click
     *Manage Files*.  You will probably see missing items in the file
     selection.  This is normal, since path to your files may be different in
     the container.
  5. Update the file selection by re-adding your files.  **Do not unselect
     missing items yet**.
  6. Perform a backup.  Because of deduplication, files will not be uploaded
     again.
  7. Once the backup is terminated, you can remove missing items **if you
     don't care about file versions**.  Else, keep missing items.

**NOTE**: Don't be confused by the directory structure from your old being
visible in the *Manage Files* window.  By default, your files are now located
under the `/storage` folder.

## Why CrashPlan Self Update Is Disabled

One advantage of a Docker image is that it can be versioned and predictable,
meaning that a specific version of the image always behaves the same way.  So
if, for any reason, a new image version has a problem and doesn't work as
expected, it's easy for one to revert to the previous version and be back on
track.

Allowing CrashPlan to update itself obviously breaks this benefit.  Also, since
the container has only the minimal set of libraries and tools required to run
CrashPlan, it would be easy for an automatic update to break the container by
requiring new dependencies.  Finally, the automatic update script is not adapted
for Alpine Linux (the distribution on which this container is based on) and
assumes it is running on a full-featured distribution.  For example, this image
doesn't have a desktop like normal installations and some of the tools required
to perform the update are missing.

## Troubleshooting

### Crashes / Maximum Amount of Allocated Memory

If CrashPlan crashes unexpectedly with large backups, try to increase the
maximum amount of memory CrashPlan is allowed to use. This can be done by:

  1. Setting the `CRASHPLAN_SRV_MAX_MEM` environment variable.  See the
     [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for more details.
  2. Using the [solution provided by CrashPlan] from its support site.

[solution provided by CrashPlan]: https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827635282583-Adjust-Code42-agent-settings-for-memory-usage-with-large-backups

### Inotify's Watch Limit

If CrashPlan exceeds inotify's max watch limit, real-time file watching cannot
work properly and the inotify watch limit needs to be increased on the **host**,
not the container.

For more details, see the CrashPlan's [Linux real-time file watching errors]
article.

[Linux real-time file watching errors]: https://support.code42.com/hc/en-us/articles/14827708807959-Linux-real-time-file-watching-errors

#### Synology

On Synology NAS, the instructions provided by the article mentioned in the
previous section apply, except that the inotify's max watch limit must be set in
`/etc.defaults/sysctl.conf` (instead of `/etc/sysctl.conf`) to make the setting
permanent.

**NOTE**: After an upgrade of the DSM software, verify that the content of the
file has not been overwritten.

### Empty `/storage`

If the `/storage` folder inside the container is empty:

  - Make sure the folder is properly mapped to the host.  This is done via the
    `-v` parameter of the `docker run` command.  See the [Usage](#usage)
    section.
  - Make sure permissions and ownership of files on the host are correct and are
    compatible with the user under which the container application is running
    (defined by the `USER_ID` and `GROUP_ID` environment variables).  See the
    [User/Group IDs](#usergroup-ids) section.

NOTE: If running the application as root (`USER_ID=0` and `GROUP_ID=0`) makes
the files visible, it confirms that there is a permission issue.

### Device Status Is Waiting For Connection

If the status of your device is stuck on *Waiting for connection*, clearing the
the cache of CrashPlan can help resolve the issue:

  - Stop the container.
  - Remove all the content of the `cache` directory found under the container's
    configuration directory.  For example, if the `/config` folder of the
    container is mapped to `/docker/appdata/crashplan-pro` on the host, the
    following command (ran on the host) would clear the cache:
    ```
    rm -rf /docker/appdata/crashplan-pro/cache/*
    ```
  - Start the container.

### Cannot Restore Files

If CrashPlan fails to restore files, make sure the location where files are
restored have write permission.

A typical installation has the data to be backup under the `/storage` folder.
This folder is usually mapped to the host with *read-only* permission.  Thus,
restoring files to `/storage` won't be allowed.  The solution is to temporarily
change the permission of the volume to *read-write*.

For example, if `/storage` is mapped to `/home/user` on the host, the container
would need to be deleted and then re-created with the same arguments, with the
exception of `-v /home/user:/storage:ro` that is replaced with
`-v /home/user:/storage:rw`.

### Upgrade Failed Error Message

Because the CrashPlan's self-upgrade feature is disabled in this container, an
error message about failed upgrade can be seen when a new CrashPlan version is
released.

To fix this, [updating the container's image](#docker-image-update) to the
latest version will also bring the latest version of CrashPlan.
